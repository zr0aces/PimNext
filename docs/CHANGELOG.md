# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.2] – 2026-08-23

### Changed
- Version bump to `1.2.2`.

---
## [1.2.1] – 2026-08-23

### Changed
- Version bump to `1.2.1`.

### Fixed
- **CUPS output could silently break `/status`, `/jobs` and `/cancel`.** `run_cups_query()` wrapped its error string in backticks and `status`/`jobs_command` fenced raw `lpstat` output in triple backticks, all sent with `parse_mode="Markdown"`. `/jobs` lists every job on the printer, not just this bot's — a backtick, or an unmatched `_`/`*`, in another client's job title or in CUPS stderr fails Telegram's Markdown entity parser, and the whole reply is rejected by the API rather than degrading gracefully. All three handlers now send plain text; `run_cups_query()`'s docstring records why formatting must not come back without escaping.
- **No global error handler.** Any unhandled exception in any handler — including the one above — was only logged; the user got total silence with no indication their message did anything. `error_handler()` is now registered via `application.add_error_handler()`: it logs the exception and best-effort replies with a generic apology.
- **Unsupported message types were dropped with no feedback.** A voice note, sticker, video, GIF, or contact card matched neither of the two `MessageHandler`s (photo/document, text) and vanished silently. A third, catch-all `MessageHandler` (`unsupported_message`) now replies pointing at `/help`; it's registered last so it only catches what the other two don't.
- **`PTBUserWarning` on every startup** — the preferences `ConversationHandler` enters via `/start`/`/preferences` (`CommandHandler`) but walks a single message through its three states via `CallbackQueryHandler` + `edit_message_text`, so PTB warned that `per_message=False` (the correct setting for this — the standard command-entry, callback-state wizard — pattern) won't track callbacks per message. `per_message=True` is not applicable here: it requires entry points and fallbacks to also be `CallbackQueryHandler`, and `/start`, `/preferences`, `/cancel` are commands. The warning is expected noise for this pattern and is now suppressed with a scoped `warnings.catch_warnings()` around just that construction, rather than printed on every process start.

## [1.2.0] – 2026-08-22

### Added
- **`1x` copy option** — explicitly resets the copy count to one. Previously only `2x`–`4x` existed, so there was no way to undo a multi-copy setting without waiting out the 30-minute session.
- **Blank-page padding in half mode** — a single file printed with `half` now gets a blank second page appended to the merged PDF, so CUPS applies a true 2-up layout on one physical sheet instead of letting the driver scale the content to a full page.
- **`docs/USER-SPEC.md`** — a single user-facing specification: every command, every print option, the half-sheet workflow, session and preference lifetimes, and the hard limits. Previously these were spread across `HELP_TEXT`, the README and this changelog.
- **`test_bot.py`** — a dependency-free self-check (`python3 test_bot.py`) covering option parsing, the preference persistence round-trip, the half-mode extension gate, and version consistency between `bot.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md` and this changelog. It also covers the shared cooldown helper and asserts the preference cap is a constant rather than an environment variable.
- **`scripts/bump_version.py`** — a single `VERSION` file at the repo root is now the source of truth; `bot.py` reads it at import (`DEFAULT_VERSION` is only the fallback if the file is missing). `python3 scripts/bump_version.py {patch|minor|major|set X.Y.Z}` rewrites `VERSION`, `bot.py`, `docker-compose.yml` (both the `image:` tag and the build arg), `README.md`, `docs/USER-SPEC.md` and this changelog together; `check` (also `test_bot.py::test_bump_version_helpers`) verifies they agree.

### Fixed
- **The version-sync tool did not actually sync.** Caught before commit by running `patch`/`minor`/`set` end to end in an isolated copy: `sync_version()`'s regexes were written against a layout that had already been refactored away — a literal `VERSION = "x"` in `bot.py` (now `VERSION = _load_version()`), `${DOCKER_IMAGE:-...}` wrapping the image tag in `docker-compose.yml`, and a `DOCKER_IMAGE=` line in `.env.example` — so the script silently no-opped on `bot.py` and the image tag while still printing "✓ Updated", and its own `check` failed immediately after the bump it exists to support. `bot.py` now exposes the named `DEFAULT_VERSION` constant the regex looks for, the `docker-compose.yml` regex matches the plain (non-wrapped) image tag, the dead `.env.example` step is removed, and `check_consistency()` checks the exact literals `sync_version()` writes instead of loose substrings. Verified by round-tripping `patch` → `minor` → `set 2.0.0-rc1` through `check` in an isolated copy — all three pass.
- **`logger = logging.getLogger("notanext")` had been dropped** from `bot.py` in the same uncommitted edit that introduced `VERSION`-file loading — every `logger.*` call in the file (dozens of them, including the first line of `main()`) would have raised `NameError` at runtime. Restored.

### Fixed — Security
- **`/start` and `/preferences` were unrestricted.** The preference wizard's entry points carried no chat filter, so any Telegram user could reach it and consume one of the `MAX_PREFERENCES` slots (default 10) — locking legitimate users out with "the preference store is full". Both entry points now use the same `ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` filter as `/jobs`, `/cancel`, `/clean`, and the file handlers.

### Fixed
- **Half mode silently ignored unmergeable file types.** `.txt`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.odt` and `.ps` are printable but cannot be merged into a PDF, so a `.docx` sent in half mode fell back to a plain multi-file `lp` job and printed full-page — contradicting the 1.1.1 entry below. Such files are now rejected at queue time with a message pointing at `normal` mode, and `print_file` raises rather than falling through. The mergeable set is a module constant (`MERGEABLE_EXTENSIONS`) instead of being redefined inside `print_file`.
- **`docker-compose.yml` overrode `.env`.** `CUPS_SERVER`, `PRINTER_NAME` and `TZ` were hardcoded under `environment:`, which takes precedence over `env_file:` — so following the README's "fill in TOKEN, CUPS_SERVER, PRINTER_NAME" had no effect on the Compose path. The block is removed; all configuration now comes from `.env`.
- **`.dockerignore` referenced `pimnext.service`**, a filename that has not existed since the 1.1.1 rename. The rule was dead and the systemd unit was being copied into the image; it now correctly excludes `notanext.service`.
- **`/cancel` collision is no longer silent.** The command is bound both as the wizard's fallback and as the print-queue canceller; while the wizard is open the fallback wins. The cancellation reply now says to send `/cancel` again to reach the print-queue meaning.
- **README corrections** — the print-options table was missing `color`, `1x`, `2up`, `normal`, `full`, `single`, `1up` and `print`; the `half` row described "A5 content on A4 paper" when `half` actually sets `number-up=2` and queues files; and the session-expiry note claimed options "reset to defaults (colour, 1 copy, A4)" when they have fallen back to the chat's *saved* defaults since 1.1.2.

### Changed
- **`PrintOptions` and `HalfQueueEntry` dataclasses** replace the bare dicts that were passed between the wizard, the session store, the persistence layer, the half-mode queue and `print_file`. `print_file(paths, opts)` takes one object instead of four positional parameters, and the colour/sheet-mode labels used across every reply live on the type as properties.
- **Shared CUPS query helper** — `/status`, `/jobs` and `/cancel` were three copies of the same binary check, `-h <server>` wiring, timeout handling and stderr truncation; they now share `run_cups_query()`. Their failure messages are correspondingly more uniform.
- **Shared print helper** — the normal and half-mode paths were two copies of the same print → notify → reply → clean-up block, so a fix to one could miss the other. Both now call `_print_and_reply()`.
- **Reusable HTTP client & pre-built keyboards** — Home Assistant notification reuses a persistent `httpx.AsyncClient` connection pool, and inline keyboards are instantiated once at module load to reduce allocations and resource consumption.
- **`set_print_options` renamed to `handle_text_message`** — it is the text handler, and it also flushes the print queue, so the old name described neither. Keyword parsing is split out into the pure `parse_option_tokens()`, which is what the new test exercises.
- **`print_file` no longer returns its command string** — no caller used it. The string is still attached to raised errors as `.cmd` for the Telegram reply.
- **Reusable HTTP client and pre-built keyboards** — Home Assistant notifications now share one persistent `httpx.AsyncClient` (and its connection pool) instead of building and tearing one down per print, and the three wizard keyboards are constructed once at import instead of on every callback.
- **Shared cooldown helper** — the normal and half-mode paths each carried their own copy of the elapsed/remaining rate-limit arithmetic; both now call `cooldown_remaining()`.
- **`perform_cleanup()` uses `os.scandir()`** instead of `os.listdir()` plus a per-entry `os.path.isfile()` stat.
- **`merge_to_pdf()` no longer leaks a file handle per PDF input.** `PdfReader(path)` kept the handle open for the process's lifetime; the reader now runs inside a `with open(...)` block, which is safe because `PdfWriter.add_page()` clones eagerly. The image branch also stopped rebinding the name bound by `with Image.open(...)`, which read as if the converted copy were the one being closed.
- **The shared Home Assistant client is closed on shutdown** via a `post_shutdown` hook, instead of leaving its connection pool to process exit.
- **Every fix recorded in this changelog was re-validated against the tree** (62 checks over 1.0.0–1.2.0: subprocess reaping, the pre-download size and extension gates, the rate-limit slot claim, the Canon dual grayscale flags, the half-mode merge, the systemd and entrypoint hardening). One regression surfaced and was reverted: an attempt to shorten the `LOG_LEVEL` block had dropped the invalid-value warning that 1.0.6 added specifically to kill a silent fallback. `merge_to_pdf()` was additionally exercised against real `pypdf` and `Pillow` — 10 checks covering RGBA/grayscale conversion, mixed image+PDF input, blank-page padding geometry, unmergeable rejection, and file-descriptor growth over 30 merges.

### Removed
- **`MAX_PREFERENCES` and `DOCKER_IMAGE` environment variables.** The preference cap is a safety bound, not a tuning knob — it is now the module constant `MAX_PREFERENCES = 10`, and the `get_preferences_limit()` parser, its validation warning and the "raise the limit" hint in the full-store reply are gone. `DOCKER_IMAGE` only wrapped `docker-compose.yml`'s `image:` in a `${VAR:-default}`; the tag is now written directly, and `docker compose up -d --build` still builds it locally.
- **`PRINT_OPTIONS_TTL` and `HALF_QUEUE_TTL`** — both had become bare aliases of `SESSION_TTL` with no remaining references.

## [1.1.3] – 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Version bump to `v1.1.3` across runtime constant, Docker tag defaults, and documentation references.

## [1.1.2] – 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Persistent default print preferences** via `/preferences` (and `/start` wizard): users can now save per-chat defaults for color mode, sheet mode (normal/half), and paper size (A4/A5).

### Changed
- **Telegram command registration updated**: bot command menu is now kept in sync at startup using `set_my_commands`, including `/preferences` in the registered command list.
- **Documentation refresh**: README command table and usage sections now document `/preferences`, default-vs-temporary option behavior, and command menu registration.

## [1.1.1] – 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **Project renamed from PimNext to NotaNext**: updated all references across the codebase and configuration files.

### Fixed
- **Half mode multi-file printing**: Files sent in half mode are now mathematically merged into a single PDF before passing to CUPS. This reliably forces CUPS to place exactly 2 distinct submissions side-by-side on exactly half of one physical sheet. Previously, CUPS would automatically separate them and place them on individual pages.

---

## [1.1.0] – 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **Project renamed from PrintBot to PimNext**: updated all references across `README.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `.env.example`, `bot.py`, and the systemd unit file.
- **Docker image**: new image path is `ghcr.io/zr0aces/pimnext` (previously `ghcr.io/zr0aces/printbot`).
- **Systemd unit**: `printbot.service` renamed to `pimnext.service`; default working directory updated to `/home/pi/pimnext`.
- **Home Assistant event**: the webhook event fired after each successful print is now `pimnext_job_sent` (previously `printbot_job_sent`). Update any existing HA automations accordingly.
- **Logger name**: internal Python logger renamed from `printbot` to `pimnext`.
- **Bot messages**: welcome and help messages updated to reference PimNext.

---

## [1.0.9] – 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Grayscale printing on Canon printers**: The bot now sends both standard `ColorModel=Gray` and Canon-proprietary `CNColorMode=mono` flags. This ensures grayscale printing works correctly on Canon UFRII LT printers (like the LBP7110Cw) which ignore standard CUPS grayscale commands.

---

## [1.0.8] – 2026-04-15

### Added
- Added support for A5 printing (`a5` option) and printing A5 content on A4 paper (`half` option).
- Print settings (color, copies, paper size) now persist for 30 minutes instead of resetting after the first print.
- Added `a4` option to explicitly reset paper size to A4.

---

## [1.0.7] – 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **`asyncio.get_event_loop()` deprecation**: `perform_cleanup_async()` now uses `asyncio.get_running_loop()` (introduced in Python 3.7, preferred from 3.10+), eliminating the `DeprecationWarning` emitted by newer Python runtimes when `get_event_loop()` is called with no running loop.

### Improved
- **Configurable Docker image via environment variable**: `docker-compose.yml` now reads the image name from the `DOCKER_IMAGE` env var (default: `ghcr.io/zr0aces/printbot:1.0.7`). This makes it easy to switch between registry, local, and custom builds without editing the Compose file. Set `DOCKER_IMAGE=local/printbot:dev` in `.env` to use a locally built image.

---

## [1.0.6] – 2026-04-15

### Fixed — Bugs
- **Subprocess leak on timeout** (`run_cups_command`): child process is now killed and reaped with `process.kill()` + `await process.wait()` before `TimeoutError` is re-raised, preventing zombie processes and open-pipe fd leaks.
- **Subprocess leak on timeout** (`print_file`): same kill/wait fix applied to the `lp` subprocess — previously the process was abandoned silently on the 30-second timeout.
- **Filename collision under concurrent prints**: switched from `int(time.time())` (1-second resolution) to `uuid.uuid4().hex` — eliminates race conditions when two users send a file in the same second.
- **Home Assistant notify in `finally` block**: moved `notify_homeassistant()` into the `try` block (after confirmed print, before the Telegram reply) to make the intent explicit and remove dependency on the `success` flag.
- **Silent `LOG_LEVEL` fallback**: invalid values (e.g. `VERBOSE`) now print a warning before defaulting to `INFO` instead of failing silently.
- **CUPS HTTP probe unreliable**: `docker-entrypoint.sh` now uses a raw TCP connect (`/dev/tcp/$CUPS_SERVER/631`) instead of `curl http://...`, which works even when the CUPS web UI is disabled.

### Fixed — Security
- **No file size limit**: file size is checked against `MAX_FILE_BYTES` (20 MB) from message metadata _before_ `download_to_drive` is called — prevents disk fill attacks.
- **No rate limiting**: added `PRINT_COOLDOWN = 10` seconds per chat with a `last_print_time` dict; users who send too fast receive a friendly message with the remaining wait time.
- **No file type whitelist**: documents are now validated against `PRINTABLE_EXTENSIONS` (`{.pdf, .ps, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .txt, .doc, .docx, .odt}`) before download.
- **Blocking HTTP on event loop**: `notify_homeassistant` was using `urllib.request.urlopen` (a blocking call that stalled the entire event loop up to 3 s). Replaced with `async def` + `httpx.AsyncClient`.
- **`.env` file permissions**: added `chmod 600 .env` to the setup instructions in `README.md`.

### Improved — Performance
- **Cached `shutil.which` calls**: `LP_BIN`, `LPSTAT_BIN`, and `CANCEL_BIN` are now resolved once at import time instead of on every command invocation.
- **`print_options` memory leak**: `cleanup_task` now sweeps and evicts expired entries that were set but never consumed (e.g. user sets `bw` and never sends a file).
- **Blocking I/O in async context**: `perform_cleanup` (uses `os.listdir` / `os.remove`) is no longer called directly from async handlers. A new `perform_cleanup_async()` wrapper offloads the work to a thread pool via `run_in_executor`.

### Improved — Code Quality
- **Type hints on all handler functions**: every command and message handler now carries `(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE) -> None` signatures.
- **`docker-compose.yml` `image:` tag**: added `image: ghcr.io/zr0aces/printbot:1.0.6` alongside `build:` so `docker compose up -d` pulls the pre-built image without requiring a local build.
- **Docker log rotation**: added `logging: driver: json-file, max-size: 10m, max-file: 3` to prevent unbounded log growth on long-running hosts.
- **`docker-entrypoint.sh` shell strictness**: changed to `set -euo pipefail` to catch undefined variable references and pipeline failures.
- **`printbot.service` hardening**: added `NoNewPrivileges`, `PrivateTmp`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, `ReadWritePaths`, and `ProtectHome` systemd directives.
- **`requirements.txt`**: added `httpx` as an explicit direct dependency (was previously only a transitive dep of `python-telegram-bot`).
- **Supply-chain guidance**: added `pip-compile --generate-hashes` instructions to `README.md` Tech Stack section.

- Updated `.gitignore`: added `.DS_Store`, `*.egg-info/`, `dist/`, and `*.log` patterns
- Updated `.dockerignore`: added `*.md` exclusion for `CONTRIBUTING.md` and improved comments

---

## [1.0.4] – 2026-04-14

### Added
- Pre-built multi-arch Docker images published to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/zr0aces/printbot`) — no local build required
- Health check improvements: `HEALTHCHECK` in `Dockerfile` now uses `pgrep -f bot.py`

### Changed

- Noisy `httpx` and `telegram` library loggers suppressed to `WARNING` level at startup
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` startup wait loop now retries up to 10 times with 2-second intervals before proceeding

---

## [1.0.3] – 2026-04-13

### Added
- All CUPS commands (`lp`, `lpstat`, `cancel`) now explicitly pass `-h <CUPS_SERVER>` for reliable remote server targeting
- `print_file()` explicitly passes `-d <PRINTER_NAME>` to `lp` — eliminates "No default destination" errors
- `print_msg()` attaches the shell command string to `RuntimeError` for inclusion in Telegram error replies
- `run_cups_command()` helper extracts shared async subprocess logic for `status`, `jobs`, and `cancel` handlers
- Async timeout (30 s) on the `lp` subprocess inside `print_file()`

### Changed
- `CUPS_SERVER` and `PRINTER_NAME` are now **required** at runtime; missing values raise `RuntimeError` with a clear message
- `get_cups_server()` and `get_printer_name()` helper functions added for centralised env-var access
- Error replies in Telegram now include truncated CUPS `stderr` (max 300 chars) via `MAX_STDERR_LENGTH` constant

---

## [1.0.2] – 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Corrected Canon PPD filename to `CNRCUPSLBP7110CZNK.ppd` across `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-entrypoint.sh`, and `README.md`
- `PRINTER_NAME` default aligned to `Canon_LBP7110Cw` in all configuration files and examples

---

## [1.0.1] – 2026-04-14

### Added
- `docker-entrypoint.sh`: dynamically writes `/etc/cups/client.conf` (`ServerName`) from `CUPS_SERVER` env var
- `docker-entrypoint.sh`: waits for CUPS server reachability (HTTP probe on port `631`) before setting the default printer
- `lpoptions -d <PRINTER_NAME>` call in entrypoint to set a system-wide default printer inside the container

### Changed
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` falls back to `cups` if `CUPS_SERVER` is not set

---
